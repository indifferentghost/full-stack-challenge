This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### First time startup

This project makes use of [Prisma](https://prisma.io/), as such the first time startup needs to generate schemas and a test database.

```bash
npm install
npm run bootstrap
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/fruit](http://localhost:3000/api/fruit). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/fruit.ts`. It's also been mapped to [http://localhost:3000/fruit] to better comply with the requirements of this challenge.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
